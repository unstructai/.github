# üåê Supercharging (Cybersecurity) Incident Response Workflows with Generative AI 

## Imagine this: ü§î

You've just launched your production service. Exciting times! But then you realize you need alerting and on-call. Boom, vendor A swoops in with a charge of ${X-1}. Next, you're struggling with manual, error-prone incident management. Enter vendor B with a price tag of ${X-2}. Next, you need to learn from incidents; you need to fight and prevent bad actors from getting in; you need status pages; you need SLO stuff.  

...And the madness continues. 

The big question is: What are we truly gaining? The major incumbents have been at a standstill for over a decade, while even the newest players, despite hefty funding, seem to be stuck in a loop of incremental improvements.

At [UnStruct.ai](https://github.com/unstructai), we're on a mission to cut through this nonsense üöÄ

In just a few minutes, you can deploy a solution that integrates top-notch open-source projects like [Dispatch by Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/dispatch/), [Timesketch by Google](https://github.com/google/timesketch), [GoAlert by Target](https://github.com/target/goalert), and [Uptime Kuma by Louislam](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma). We've enriched these with AI, added our personal touch, and made significant enhancements. Setting it up is a breeze (with just one command), and for those curious about the internals, feel free to dive into the 500,000+ lines of code that tie everything together.


Why settle for fragmented tools when you can have a holistic, powerful, open and free solution?

## One more thing: üí°

> **Did You Know?**  
> The average downtime cost for medium to large companies stands at a staggering **$10,719/min**. Furthermore, a single cybersecurity incident can set you back by **$4.35 million**. UnStruct's proposition? **Slash these costs by over 15%**.

## Dynamic Incident Engagement & Intelligent Search Filters
Navigating through the labyrinth of data during an incident can be a daunting task, requiring precision and efficiency. That's where UnStruct.AI‚Äôs Search Filters & Engagements feature steps in, serving as your compass in times of chaos. This powerful tool enables you to swiftly identify and engage the right individuals, teams, or service owners, ensuring that they are seamlessly looped into the incident's developments.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Addressing Pager/Alert Storms Effectively with Intelligence
No matter the size or type of your team, a common challenge faced by organizations in production is dealing with pager storms. This scenario, depending on your setup for alerting and monitoring, is a widespread issue that often results in over-monitoring and alert fatigue. More critically, making sense of these alerts can be daunting, hindering teams from identifying the root cause of issues.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Adaptable Plugin-Based Architecture for Scalable Integrations
In Unstruct, plugins serve as the essential integration glue, seamlessly connecting the platform to a variety of widely-used external systems across the industry. These include, but are not limited to, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Zoom, Sentry, and Google, among others. The elegance of this architecture lies in its plug-and-play nature. For instance, if you are utilizing a documents plugin to store your incident reports on Google, and another user prefers Confluence, the transition is as simple as modifying a setting. This adaptability is where the true power of the architecture is realized.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Pioneering Customizable Postmortem Checklists for Consistent Reporting
A recurring challenge observed in the compilation of postmortems is the considerable time often spent in assembling these reports. This issue, coupled with a lack of consistency and customization in the reporting templates‚Äîwhether provided by external entities or internal to your organization‚Äîresults in varied quality across postmortems. If visualized, the quality of these reports can be graphically represented as being scattered, highlighting a pressing need for uniformity and adaptability.<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/unstructai/.github/assets/5151108/e186bf0d-39b7-4800-9d37-f0e48efe8743)

<br><br>
## Pioneering Custom Incident Checklists for Enhanced Responsiveness
UnStruct introduces the pioneering concept of Custom Incident Checklists, a feature designed to enhance and standardize the incident response process. The premise is straightforward yet highly impactful‚Äîevery incident type is accompanied by a unique checklist that outlines the steps or actions required for that specific incident. For instance, a security incident will have a distinct checklist compared to an availability incident.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Lightweight Task Framework
Tasks and follow-ups play a critical role in incident management. Tasks are actions aimed at resolution, essential to complete before marking an incident as closed, while follow-ups address additional concerns after stabilizing the incident. At UnStruct, we offer a seamless, lightweight mechanism to manage these elements efficiently.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Incorporated Security DNA
At the heart of UnStruct lies an intrinsic commitment to security, providing a plethora of options to monitor signals from various sources like Sentry, Uptycs, Pagerduty and more. The platform facilitates the seamless tying of signals by extracting entities and aligning them with Signal definitions, which subsequently map to cases. This enables the automatic engagement of the appropriate individuals and initiates end-to-end orchestration designed to monitor critical signals vital to your company‚Äôs security interests.<br><br>

<br><br>
## People-First Platform
UnStruct is meticulously designed with a foundational philosophy of being a people-first, customer-centric platform. This design ethos ensures that users gain profound insights as they engage in incident management and resolution processes. Recognizing the pivotal role of individuals in addressing various incidents, our platform unveils unprecedented insights into aspects such as toil, stress, and sentiment, among others.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Embedded Privacy & RBAC
Acknowledging the paramount importance of privacy and role-based access control (RBAC), especially when managing private or sensitive incidents, UnStruct has been conscientiously designed with these principles embedded from the ground up. This foundational approach introduces the concept of private incidents ‚Äì a feature allowing incidents to be marked as private, ensuring access is exclusively granted to designated responders.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Pioneering Non-Linear Timelines and Incident/Knowledge Graphs
Traditional timelines, with their seemingly infinite scroll, often prove cumbersome both during and after an incident. We recognized this challenge and devised an innovative solution to address it. While still in Beta, our approach aims to present timelines more intuitively, resembling a double-linked list. This design facilitates a quicker path to insights, allowing users to follow along seamlessly and efficiently.
